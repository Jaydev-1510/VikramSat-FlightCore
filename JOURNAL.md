## September 3rd: Started the project!
### Day-01

Today I spent my time making a beautiful footprint for RP2350B-A4. Yeah, I have chosen the new RP2350B as the microprocesser for this board. Also, ICM-20948 as an IMU is finalised. I will not be able to keep up regularly as my exams are approaching, however I will try to accomplish something everyday. Here an image of the schematic symbol that I made today-
